# Welcome to my repo on Financial Time Series
## Why this repo? 
I am currently working on developing skills in the field of time series analysis by implementing learnings from Analysis of Financial Time Series by Ruey S. Tsay

## What has been implemented so far?

### Chapter 1 - Financial Time Series and Their Characteristics
1. **Download data:** Download data for stocks on various tickers from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Returns:** Calculate simple and log-return for stocks.
3. **Plot Returns:** Plot these returns and compare the trajectories of each against other.
4. **Distribution Parameters:** Calculate Mean, Variance, Skewness, and Kurtosis for the various series.

### Chapter 2 - Linear Timer Series and Its Applications
1. **Jarque-Bera Test of Normality:** Perform Jarque Bera test to test for Normality of the return series.
2. **Ljung-Box Test of Auto-correlation:** Test for checking whether a series has autocorrelation and at which lag.
3. **Augmented Dicky-Fuller Test:** To check for the stationarity of a series.
4. **AutoReg:** Run AutoReg and obtain results for the same using different lags.
5. **Stochastic cycle:** Calculate the stochastic cycle period for a stock.
6. **Information Criteria:** Implemented AIC and BIC to check which lag preserves the most information.
