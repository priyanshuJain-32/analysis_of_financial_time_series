# Welcome to my repo on Financial Time Series
Why this repo? 
I am currently working on developing skills in the field of time series analysis by implementing learnings from Analysis of Financial Time Series by Ruey S. Tsay

What has been implemented so far?

1. Download data: Download data for stocks on various tickers from Yahoo Finance.
2. Returns: Calculate simple and log-return for stocks.
3. Distribution Parameters: Calculate Mean, Variance, Skewness, and Kurtosis for the various series.
4. Jarque-Bera Test of Normality: Perform Jarque Bera test to test for Normality of the return series.
5. Ljung-Box Test of Auto-correlation: Test for checking whether a series has autocorrelation and at which lag.
6. Augmented Dicky-Fuller Test: To check for the stationarity of a series.
7. Run AutoReg and obtain results for the same using different lags.
8. Stochastic cycle: Calculate the stochastic cycle period for a stock.
9. Information Criteria: Implemented AIC and BIC to check which lag preserves the most information.
